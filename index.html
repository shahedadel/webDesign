  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a curious student in tech, passionate about exploring coding, cybersecurity, and robotics, and I enjoy turning ideas into functional solutions.</p>
    <p>Beyond tech, I enjoy blending creativity with purpose through personal projects and design explorations.</p>

    <h2>My Side Quests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Intelligent Systems Club (ISC) Self-driving Car Project</li>
        <p>Iâ€™ll be coding and building circuits for a hardware test bench, gaining experience in embedded systems and real-world debugging.
          I'll work on Project TinyKart, which is a small self-driving car project, where Iâ€™ll contribute to assembly and control systems coding.
        </p>
      <li>Michigan Aeronautical Science Association (MASA) Power Systems Board</li>
        <p>I helped lay the foundation for our club projects by designing the initial code structure, enabling the team leads to build on it efficiently. 
          This helped me develop a deeper understanding of collaborative coding and project workflow.</p>
      <li>Break Timer Project (Independent)</li>
          <p>People want to LOCK IN and here I am making a sensor-based project to remind me to move! The idea is that I make a sensor-based break timer designed to encourage healthier work habits. When I leave my desk, the timer starts counting down. If I return before the full break is up, the system signals me to continue resting. This project explores timing logic, motion detection, and practical applications of embedded systems for everyday productivity.</p>
    </ul>

        <p>A personal project where I explore how faith and creativity can meet in the digital world. 
        <em>Nourished by Deen</em> is a growing brand-in-progress that focuses on building tools, reflections, and designs that bring spirituality into daily life. 
        Itâ€™s my experiment in combining design, storytelling, and technology with purpose.</p>
